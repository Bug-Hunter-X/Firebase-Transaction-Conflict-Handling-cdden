# Firebase Transaction Conflict Handling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase related to handling transactions and optimistic locking. The provided code snippet shows how a transaction might fail due to concurrent updates, resulting in data inconsistency.

The solution includes enhanced transaction handling that addresses concurrent updates and ensures data integrity.

## Bug Description

The initial code attempts to increment a value in Firebase using a transaction. However, if multiple clients attempt to increment the value concurrently, the transaction might fail due to conflicts. This is because the transaction checks the current value against its initial value to ensure that no other client has changed the data during the transaction. If another client modifies the data before the transaction completes, the transaction fails, leading to inconsistencies.

## Solution

The solution incorporates a retry mechanism and a more robust conflict resolution strategy within the transaction function.
